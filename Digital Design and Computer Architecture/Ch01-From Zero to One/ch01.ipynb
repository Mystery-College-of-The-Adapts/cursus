    "\n",
    "In  addition to abstraction and discipline, designers use the three \"-y's\" to manage complexity:\n",
    "* **Hierarchy**: involves dividing a system into modules, then further subdividing each of these modules until the pieces are easy to understand.\n",
    "* **Modularity**: states that the modules have well-defined functions and interfaces, so that they connect together easily without unanticipated side effects.\n",
    "* **Regularity**: seeks uniformity among the modules. Common modules are reused many times, reducing the number of distinct modules that must be designed"
