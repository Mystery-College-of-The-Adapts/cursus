## Latency, Throughput, and Bandwidth

- **Latency** is time taken to complete an individual operation
- **Throughput** is the rate at which operations can be completed
- **Bandwidth** is the total rate at which data can be moved between the processor and the memory system. 

    i.e Bandwidth = Throughput * amount of data referenced by each memory operation.
