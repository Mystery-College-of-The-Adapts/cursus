Another is batch interface, in which commands and directives to control those commands are entered into files, and those files are executed. Most Commonly, a Graphical user interface (GUI) is used."

Best known for its implementation in Apple Inc.’s Macintosh and Microsoft Corporation’s Windows operating system, the GUI has replaced the arcane and difficult textual interfaces of earlier computing with a relatively intuitive system that has made computer operation not only easier to learn but more pleasant and natural. The GUI is now the standard computer interface, and its components have themselves become unmistakable cultural artifacts."
